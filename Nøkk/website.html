		<p>N<span>&#248;</span>kk is an Attacking character in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. She was introduced into the game in the Operation Phantom Sight expansion as a year 4 operator alongside Warden.</p>
		
		<h2> Biography </h2>
		
		<p>For reasons of National Security and currently active missions, N<span>&#248;</span>kk's records are sealed at NATO Confidential security clearance, but her files have been released to Six. N<span>&#248;</span>kk enlisted at the Army NCO School in S<span>&#248;</span>nderborg, then enrolled at the Royal Danish Military Academy where she graduated at the rank of First Lieutenant. With four deployments under her belt, N<span>&#248;</span>kk underwent additional special operations training, earning her J<span>&aelig;</span>gerkorpset maroon beret with skills in covert ops, combat search and rescue, direct action, special recon, arctic warfare, and advanced breaching. N<span>&#248;</span>kk served in Afghanistan and Iraq, often alone in deep undercover behind enemy lines. She received commendations for eliminating hostile insurgents in surgical strikes and was responsible for uncovering Erik "Maverick" Thorn's location, forwarding that intel to the Unit.
		<br>
		<br>
		N<span>&#248;</span>kk keeps her identity hidden from all but her fellow operators. NATO's O&P division recommended N<span>&#248;</span>kk for Rainbow as one of its deep cover specialists.</p>
